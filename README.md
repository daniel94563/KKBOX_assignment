KKBOX assignment 

The whole project is mainly developed on colab, but i encountered some issues that made the model trained on colab all go down the drain, so partial of the codes are built on local. (see more details in the notebook)
But it's still executable on Colab, it's okay to clone it to Colab and execute.

Apps:
The application program, should be cloned to local to execute.

Dataset:
Where the dataset stored.

Data_preprocess:
Data manipulation including word segmentation, labeling, data cleaning ...etc.

Models:
Where I set the models and stored the trained models.
NOTICE: Saving the model trained on Colab didn't work, the model should be trained and saved on local.
(All models are saved already, to retrain it, clone it to local)

IMPORTANT:
The project uses a lot of CkipTagger, make sure the Ckiptagger is installed and its pretrained models are saved properly.
To execute, please make sure it is saved in exactly the same directory. (or change the access dir in the code)
